Overview

This project is a simplified version of a school management system, inspired by the functionalities of the real USOS system. It was developed by a three-person team as part of a software engineering class.

The project consists of a Django REST API backend and an Angular frontend, demonstrating a modern web application architecture.

üöÄ Technology Stack

Backend: Python, Django REST Framework

Frontend: Angular, TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Database: SQLite

üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Documentation

The development process was accompanied by the creation of detailed design documents and diagrams.

These documents include:

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Use Case Diagram (and user stories)

Deployment Diagram

Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

API Map

üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x & Pip

Node.js & npm

Git


## How to run:

**backend:**
```
cd backend/
python manage.py runserver
```

**frontend:**
```
cd frontend-no-standalone/
ng serve --open
```

(You have to install required packages first and run venv but I'm too lazy to explain how to do that)
