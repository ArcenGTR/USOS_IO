**USOS - "Uniwersalny System Obsługi Szkół" (Universal School Service System).**
Web application for managing school tasks (lessons, grades, attendance, electronic consent etc). 
Project for software engineering classes.

## How to run:

**backend:**
```
cd backend/
python manage.py runserver
```

**frontend:**
```
cd frontend-no-standalone/
ng serve --open
```

(You have to install required packages first and run venv but I'm too lazy to explain how to do that)
